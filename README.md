### GitFind

GitFind is a project developed with React JS and the GitHub REST API to create a web application that allows users to easily search GitHub profiles and their repositories in an interactive way.

You can search for profiles using an input bar to type a username, and see information such as the name, bio, and a list of repositories for that user.
